A landing page of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.

## Backstory
Around the time I started developing this I barely had any idea about what product to be shown on a landing page and barely any design in thought. FYI, I love LEGO and I love video games, and LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is both, so I decided to imitate the [official landing page](https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/star-wars/games/skywalker-saga) with slight differences in layout and design.

## Development
This project was done with:
- HTML
- CSS

Challenges:
- Repeating elements causes HTML and CSS to be lengthy - leading to difficulties in debugging or making changes. This is one of the main reasons why React and SCSS do it better when it comes to a big landing page.
